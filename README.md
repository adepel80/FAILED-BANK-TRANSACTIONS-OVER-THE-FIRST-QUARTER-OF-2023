FAILED-BANK-TRANSACTIONS-OVER-THE-FIRST-QUARTER-OF-2023

OVERVIEW
Welcome to the Failed Bank Transaction Analysis project. In this project, we delve into the analysis of failed bank transactions to uncover insights into the reasons behind these failures. By examining transactional data, we aim to identify patterns, anomalies, and contributing factors that led to these unsuccessful transactions.

INTRODUCTION
Banking transactions are a critical aspect of financial systems, and the occurrence of failed transactions can have severe consequences for both customers and the institutions. This analysis aims to shed light on the underlying reasons behind failed bank transactions, thereby assisting banks in enhancing their risk management strategies.

DATA COLLECTION
The dataset used for this analysis was collected from various banking institutions, Traders, business men encompassing a wide range of transaction types, including payments, transfers, withdrawals, and more. It also includes data related to the accounts involved, transaction timestamps, and additional contextual information.

DATA PREPROCESSING
Before diving into the analysis, we performed data preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and organize the dataset. This involved handling missing values, standardizing transaction codes, and ensuring data consistency.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
Our exploratory data analysis phase aimed to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset. We visualized transaction trends over time, identified peak transaction periods, and examined the distribution of failed transactions across different transaction types, banks, gender and Jobs.

FAILED TRANSACTION PATTERN
By closely examining the failed transactions, we identified recurring patterns that could contribute to transaction failures. These patterns include:

Unusual transaction amounts
High-frequency transactions from a single account
Sudden changes in transaction behavior
Risk Factors Identification
To enhance our understanding, we delved into identifying potential risk factors that could lead to transaction failures. Some of the identified risk factors are:
Insufficient funds in the originating account
Fraudulent activities
Technical glitches in the transaction processing system


Results and Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights:

INSIGHT:
1)Trader has most transaction of all the occupation with almost 554,000 while lawyers are shown to have the least transaction of this analysis
2)Analysis shows that the customers with failed transaction has an average age of 30.14 years and FEMALE dominating with 65.56% of the population
3)Male dominate the weekly transaction with 66.56% and first bank and Zenith bank has total sum amount for failed transaction over the first quarter of 2023 of the sampled 14 banks
4) I will advise on initiation of money transfer with fingerprint which would at least bring about reduction to failed transaction caused by failed access from network provider or bad network from commercial banks
5) The southern region has the highest average failed transactions while the 	WEST has highest failed transaction through POS and BANK APP respectively.

Transactions with amounts significantly deviating from the account's usual behavior are more likely to fail.
A substantial increase in transaction frequency from a single account might indicate suspicious activity.
Failed transactions often result from technical issues rather than intentional fraud.

CONCLUSION
The Failed Bank Transaction Analysis project underscores the importance of understanding transaction failure patterns and identifying risk factors. By implementing the insights gained from this analysis, banking institutions can proactively address transaction-related issues and enhance customer experience.
